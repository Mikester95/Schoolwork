						This section deals with the more mathematical aspects of computer science.  If you aren't good at maths, you're about to become. Not only is it easier to visualize math problems through the eyes of a computer scientist, but you'll also discover that you need a computer to do the heavy computation in order to put all that nice mathematical knowledge to good use.
